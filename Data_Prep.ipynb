    "# Fetch provides value to our user base through the rich variety of offers that are active in the app. \n",
    "#  We want our users to be able to easily seek out offers in the app, so that they get the most out of using the app and our partners get the most out of their relationship with Fetch.\n",
    "# For this assignment, you will build a tool that allows users to intelligently search for offers via text input from the user.\n",
    "# You will be provided with a dataset of offers and some associated metadata around the retailers and brands that are sponsoring the offer. \n",

    "# Acceptance Criteria\n",
    "# If a user searches for a category (ex. diapers) the tool should return a list of offers that are relevant to that category.\n",
    "# If a user searches for a brand (ex. Huggies) the tool should return a list of offers that are relevant to that brand.\n",
